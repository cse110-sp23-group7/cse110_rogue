# Use CodeClimate for Controlling Code Quality

## Context and Problem Statement

How will we control code quality to ensure that all the code our team members write is consistent and well written? 

How can we ensure that across a long period of development, we will encounter the least bugs and structure issues with our code.

## Considered Options

* CodeClimate
* Codeacy
* SonarQube
* Atlassian Crucible

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **CodeClimate**, because it has better developer reviews, it's the TA recommended option, and it seems the most straightforward to implementing within our pipeline.
