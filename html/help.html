        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Starting the Adventure:</strong> When you first enter the Dungeon Adventure, you will be greeted by a welcome screen. At this point, no fortunes or status effects are applied to you. Prepare yourself for an exciting journey by clicking the "Start" button.</li>
            <li><strong>Seeking Fortunes:</strong> After starting the adventure, you will be prompted to seek guidance from the mystical forces by engaging in an RNG (random number generator) activity. You can shake an 8ball, draw a tarot card, or participate in any other form of RNG offered. The fortune or power you receive will affect your entire run, so choose wisely!</li>
            <li><strong>Interactive Scenarios:</strong> As you progress through the dungeon, you will encounter interactive scenarios. These scenarios present you with choices that shape the outcome of your adventure. Pay close attention to the fortunes and status effects currently applied to you, as they may influence the available choices and their consequences.</li>
            <li><strong>Status Effects and Limitations:</strong> The fortunes and powers you acquire during your adventure have tangible effects on your journey. For example, if you receive a fortune indicating reduced health points, you may face physical limitations that affect your choices and actions. Adapt your strategy accordingly to overcome these challenges.</li>
            <li><strong>Obtaining New Fortunes:</strong> After completing each scenario, you will have the opportunity to obtain another fortune or power. This adds a new layer of unpredictability and excitement to your adventure. The status effects you acquire will stay with you until you reload the webpage.</li>
            <li><strong>Reload or Continue:</strong> You can choose to end your adventure at any point by reloading the webpage. Reloading will reset all fortunes and status effects, allowing you to start a new run from the beginning. If you wish to continue your adventure and preserve your progress, simply stay on the webpage and keep playing.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Experiment and Explore:</strong> Don't be afraid to try different RNG activities to discover unique fortunes and powers. Each run offers a new opportunity for unexpected surprises and outcomes.</li>
            <li><strong>Consider your Status Effects:</strong> Pay attention to the fortunes and status effects currently applied to you. They may present challenges, but they can also provide advantages if used strategically.</li>
