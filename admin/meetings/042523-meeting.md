## Agenda
- [x] Catch everyone up regarding the 8-ball project
- [x] Go through documentation and divide up rules which are due tomorrow at noon
- [x] Figure out unit tests for our javascript

## 8-ball project
- two .css files (one for the home screen and one for the play/shake screen), one .js file, one .html file
- programming is complete and we can build on it more if we have time
- We have a presentation and video created (demonstrating the app in one minute)

## Documentation
- Considering using Doxygen for our documentation because Ankit uses it at his work and is familiar with it
> May consider other options because after further research, it looks like Doxygen isn't used for .js, .html, and .css
- Ankit and others plan to work on documentation tonight and aim to complete tonight
- Mostly user documentation i.e. how the user should use our application and why we chose certain features rather than explaining our code
- Ensure code is well commented
- Ada and others will work on commenting the .css files
- Matthew and others will comment on app.js
- Mostly good on comments

## Planning ahead
- We plan on brainstorming what our project is going to look like in the following week
- Need to decide if we would want to build off of this one or start with a different idea

## Unit Testing
- Plan to have another team work on this tonight as well
