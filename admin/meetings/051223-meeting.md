## Brainstorm midterm questions for extra credit
- coding question based on Lab 4, given a coding snippet what would this print
- given HTML code, what is the DOM value? Have 5 questions under that
    - Event listeners, query selectors, class selectors, multi-choose question
    - How can you access this element
    - i.e. getElementbyID
    - each option would be a different line in javascript
- Attempting to stay away from questions that are too technical, focus on content from lecture
- Table this conversation for later

## Eddie presents what he talked to with Gagan
### Discussion
- Rough compiled list of sample art to use 
- 3 character sprites
- 2 backgrounds
- common txt boxes
- items, stretch features, etc.
- if there are any missing pixel arts then there is free software for us to draw our own, though not likely
- suggestion to make it more personal to CSE 110 is by putting a picture of Mr. Powell in the text box
- Most importantly, organizing the game screens and art that we would like to use asap
- somehow incorporate memes into the fortune!

## Ankit is shows code

- Fortunes are a flat increase or decrease
- Encounters, pass and fail based on a baseline number
- repo has a framework for unit testing
- JSON for fortunes is finalized but JSON for encounters is not
- Code will be visible on github by 8pm tonight

## Additional
- Start thinking about what role you would like to take on: front end, back end, testing, CI, etc.
- Organize how we are splitting up work
