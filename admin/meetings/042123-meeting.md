## Completion of the Team Page

We wrote introductions for ourselves in the Zoom chat so our project leads can edit team.md easily.
As for the values we espouse as a team, we have chosen the values discussed when we established our group contract as the foundation of the team.
The branding was also chosen in the previous meeting.

## Talk about the Video

We made sure that every person has uploaded their portion, so that our editor Mary
can put it together.

## Magic 8 Ball

We decided to create a finite state diagram to represent our desired UI/UX, then
we will decide which portion is assigned to which team member.

Ankit has experience with Jest, and he has volunteered to set up the testing
infrastructure and write a README.md as a tutorial for other team members.

We also decided who will show up Saturday (6:30 PM - 7:30 PM) 
and Sunday (12 PM - completion) to complete our project.

Saturday: Nishant, Raj, Steven, Matthew, Ankit
Sunday: Anukul, Eddie, Ada, Nishant, Raj
