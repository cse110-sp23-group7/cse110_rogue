## Code Quality
- We chose **Codeclimate**

Code Climate is the way we are going. After inspection of both CodeClimate and Codacy, we found that both are useful code quality technologies. However between both of those, CodeClimate has better reviews. They both have very similar features and are rated highly with code climate having a highly-rated autosync with Github which should be very helpful for this project. We also checked out two other technologies. First we checked out SonarQube. There are a few others but this one is the most popular, which often correlates to being a great product. It is open source and works on 29 different programming languages. Some pros are that it tracks code complexity and smell trends and has IDE integration. Another big code quality software is Atlassian Crucible, this software is similar but is not used as much. It has Jira integration which is a plus. I think SonarQube is a better choice because it is used more, this usually means that if we have a problem with it there is a higher chance someone else had that problem and posted their solution online. It was also released in 2006 rather than Crucibleâ€™s 2020 release date. This means that it has been in the market longer and probably has less bugs. Despite this, we will go with the TA recommended Code Climate.
