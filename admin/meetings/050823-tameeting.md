## Agenda
1. Present Project Pitch

## Pitch
- The idea we had was okayed by the TA for the most part
- Graphics might be challenging, so we have to provide pixel art libraries to our TA to explain how we'll do them before getting fully checked off
- It was initially confusing what the idea was, but after showing the wireframes it was clear how fortune telling was used and how this isn't a generic game with controls and was mostly just with buttons
